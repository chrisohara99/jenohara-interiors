          <h2>Meet Jen</h2>
          <p>I believe your home should be a reflection of who you are — not a showroom, but a sanctuary. A place that welcomes you at the end of a long day and makes everyday moments feel a little more special.</p>
          <p>My approach is collaborative and personal. I listen first, then translate your vision into spaces that balance beauty with function, elegance with comfort. Every detail matters, but it should never feel precious.</p>
          <p>Based in the New York area, I work with clients who appreciate quality, timelessness, and design that doesn't shout — it simply feels right.</p>
